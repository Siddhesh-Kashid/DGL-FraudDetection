# DGL-FraudDetection
Complex data can be represented as a graph of relationships and interactions between objects. Graph data structures can be ingested by algorithms such as neural networks to perform tasks including classification, clustering, and regression. 
Relying on this property of `Graph Data Structure` to hold generate and hold complex relations between different features of the data I've made an attempt to create a `Graph Convolution Network(GraphCONV)` and `SAGEConv` using the **Deep Graph Library (DGL)**.
This project is an attempt to build a simple graph data structure from the IBM's [Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset]() and build **GCN** and **SAGEConv** using Pytorch framework.
The training and validation results are also being provided in the uploaded notebook.
